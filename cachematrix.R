## helpful functions to create matrices with cachable inverses
## so that if inverse was calculated before it's stored as cache

## makes a matrix closure to be stored with its cached inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        i <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() i
    list(set = set,
         get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## gets inverse if it's cached or calculates inverse and cache it if it's not
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    i <- x$getinverse()
    if (!is.null(i)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(i)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    i <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(i)
    i
}
